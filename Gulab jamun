    <h2>INGRIDIENTS</h2>
    <h5>FOR THE JAMUN</h5>
    <ol>
       <li>1 cup full-fat milk powder</li>
       <Li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</Li>
       <Li>1/8 teaspoon baking powder</Li>
       <Li>1 tablespoon ghee (You can find it at the store or make ghee from scratch.)</Li>
       <Li>5 to 6 tablespoons milk, as needed</Li>
       <Li>Oil for deep-frying</Li>
    </ol>
    <h5>FOR THE SUGAR SYRUP</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1-1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon rose essence or 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons rose water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, to prevent the sugar syrup from crystallizing</li>
    </ol>
    <li> STEP 1:Prepare The Dough 
       <br>
       <p>In a mixing bowl, add the milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder and ghee.
          Slowly add the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and gently form the dough by mixing. It should be a stiff dough. If the dough is sticky, 
          grease your palms with oil and gently mix. Do not knead the dough—it will make the jamuns hard.
        </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>STEP2: Let The Dough Rest.
        <br>
        <p>COVER the dough with a damp cloth.Let it rest for upto 5 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>STEP3:Prepare the sugar syrup.
        <br>
        <p>In a saucepan, add the sugar, water and two green cardamom pods, crushed.
           Bring the mixture to a boil and let the sugar dissolve. When the sugar is completely dissolved, simmer over medium-low heat for 5 
           to 6 minutes. We need a sticky-consistency sugar syrup here.
        </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Step 4: Roll the jamuns.
        <br> 
        <p>Grease your palms and pinch a small amount of dough. Roll gently to form a small, smooth ball—to give you an idea of the size, I make
           about 20 jamuns using this recipe.
        </p> 
    </li>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Step 5: Fry the jamuns.
        <br>
        <p>In a heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, heat a few inches of oil over low heat. The oil should not be very hot while frying the gulab jamuns.
            To test the oil, drop in a small piece of the dough. It will sink initially, but after 30 seconds or so, it will float up, and the color 
            should not change. That’s the right temperature.Slowly drop in 4 to 5 balls, depending on the pan size, and deep-fry the jamuns until
            they turn golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, keep rotating them in the oil for even cooking and coloring. It takes me 4 to 5 minutes 
            for each batch. Do not rush the frying process!When the jamuns are golden brown, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.
        </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Step 6: Add jamuns to the sugar syrup.
        <br>
        <p>Let each jamun sit for 45 to 60 seconds,and then add the fried jamuns to the warm sugar syrup.Repeat with the next batch of jamuns, frying 
           them and then adding them to the sugar syrup. Let the jamuns soak in the sugar syrup for at least 2 hours. Overnight soaking is fine, too.
        </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Step 7: Garnish You can eat gulab jamun cold or warm.
        <br>   
        <p>Put the jamuns in a serving bowl and drizzle the extra syrup on top.Garnish with nuts or rose petals and serve.</p>

    <i><h2> How to Store Gulab Jamun</h2></i>
    <p>Gulab jamun usually stays good at room temperature for 4 to 5 days. You can refrigerate and freeze them, too. But trust me, they are super addictive,
    and will be gone in no time.If you are refrigerating, you can reheat them in the microwave for 30 seconds and serve warm or bring them to room temperature
    and serve. For a decadent treat, make one of these Indian recipes for dinner, followed by warm gulab jamun paired with homemade ice cream.
